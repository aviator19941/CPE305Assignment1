Uber has many shared features with UberEATS. Almost all the
classes should remain the same because the Customer will 
represent the Passenger and the Restaurant will be the destination
that the Customer wants to order food from. The Transactions and 
Trips will still be calculated a similar way. The Customer will be 
in a static position, while the Driver will have a Trip from its 
starting position to the Restaurant the Customer provides and the 
Customer's static position.
